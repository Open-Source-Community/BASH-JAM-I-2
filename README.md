# BASH-JAM-I-2
Collection of simple bash scripts written in a week by the team members.
This is BASH-JAM Version One.
  - BASH-JAM is an idea to practice bash scripting in a competetive way, where you have to create a useful tool in a limited time.
  - BASH-JAM version 2 is for OSC-Linux members only.
    - This is the link for version 1 [BASH-JAM-I versoin 1](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community/BASH-JAM-I) 
  - I hope the next versions will have more contributions, which will be public for everyone who sees the beauty of bash.

## How to Contribute ?
